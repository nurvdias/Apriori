# Apriori

This is an implementation of the Apriori algorithm from the IMDB-5000 dataset. I have performed a market-basket analysis showing the items that appear together. The algorithm was written by some dude; I've pulled his repository and uploaded it as well, so you're welcome to use his implementation. This was written for learning purposes.
